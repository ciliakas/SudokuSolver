# SudokuSolver

A Sudoku game solver and board generator. Uses depth first search to solve boards, and can use random sequences for a more random solving or generating.

It is quite slow, and can take up to a minute (realistically 30 seconds) to solve a board.

There a quite a lot of small and big improvements that could be made for optimisation. For example, could use some deductive logic to start filling out from more appropriate pocisions that would lead to less wasted searches.
